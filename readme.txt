This is the Final Project for Spring Semester 2022 at NMC for CIT190 JAVASCRIPT and JQUERY. 
NOT TO BE USED WITH OUT PERMISSION FROM THE CREATOR MAKSIM ALEKSEYENKO
The games are not very complicated, but they were fun to create. I am aiming to improve my personal creativity in creating canvas and javascript games.
Part of the learning process is finding out exactly what JS is capable of and utilizing that to my advantage.
